## Welcome to One of Our Favorite Projects ✨

At **Hybrid Interiors**, every space tells a story — and this Kilimani home was no different.

From the *open-plan kitchen* to the *custom teak wall finishes*, our team transformed this once-empty shell into a luxurious, yet liveable, family sanctuary.

### 🛋️ The Living Room

The client wanted **warmth with modern elegance** — so we used:

- Beige textured walls  
- A floating entertainment console  
- Layered lighting with soft ambient tones  
- Teak and black accent furniture for contrast

> _"The final space feels calm, classy, and completely personal."_ — the homeowner

---

### 🍽️ Kitchen & Dining

We installed:
- A modern island kitchen with matte cabinetry
- Ambient under-cabinet lighting
- Open shelves with African pottery for cultural warmth

---

### 🛏️ Bedrooms with Character

Each bedroom had its own mood:
- The master suite featured a **velvet green headboard**
- Kids’ rooms used bold wallpapers and fun lights
- All wardrobes were custom-made in our workshop
